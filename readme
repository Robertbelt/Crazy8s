Crazy 8's game

Written in .NET 4.5 and using WinForms

Play a game of Crazy 8s against the Computer in Random hands or a quasi-random preset hand where both parties are distributed crazy 8s.

What I learned: 
  Used the symbolic debugger to help locate and solve logic issues.
  Used inheritance to reuse code from prior card game.
  Error Handling incase of missing card files.
  Used OOP concepts to write limit code repetition.
